Introduction: 

Hello, my name is Si-Jin Guo (although I often go by SJ to those who know me) and I am a researcher working in digital communications, medical sociology and science, technology and society. My current research focus is on the classification and depiction of intersex conditions/bodies and the impact of scientific rhetoric in this area on social stigma experienced by those with intersex traits. My current thesis work sets out to test a novel digital resource against existing digital resources (such as Wikipedia) and assessing whether or not perceptions of intersex bodies can be destigmatized due to exposure to more humanizing narratives in conveying information.

Areas of Interest: 

Demedicalization, stigma, digital communities, intersex/differences of sex development, 'biodivergence', health communications, digital representations of disability, rhetoric of medicine
