Introduction: 

Hello, my name is Si-Jin Guo (although I often go by SJ to those who know me) and I am a researcher working in digital communications, medical sociology and science, technology and society. My current research focus is on the classification and depiction of intersex conditions/bodies and the impact of scientific rhetoric in this area on social stigma experienced by those with intersex traits.
